# Sudoku Solver

## Introduction
Welcome to Sudoku Solver, a Python project I developed to showcase the power of Python in solving Sudoku puzzles. This project focuses on efficiently solving Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithms and organizing the code in a class-based structure.

## Development
Sudoku Solver was developed using Python and Visual Studio Code, making it an excellent project for both beginners and Python enthusiasts to learn and hone their Python skills.

## Main Features
- **Dynamic Puzzle Generation**: The solver generates a dynamically created puzzle every time, adding variety and complexity to the experience.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Utilizing a backtracking algorithm, the solver efficiently finds solutions, highlighting my strong understanding of algorithms and problem-solving skills.
- **Class-Based Organization**: I structured the code using classes and methods to emphasize the importance of well-organized and encapsulated code logic, promoting maintainability and readability.
